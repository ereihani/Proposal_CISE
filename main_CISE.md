## Proposed Geographical Region of Service

This transformative initiative will catalyze equitable innovation by partnering with institutions serving diverse communities across California's Central Valley---including California State University, Bakersfield (CSUB), University of California, Berkeley (UCB), and the Kern Community College District (KCCD). These strategic partnerships represent more than mere test sites; they embody our commitment to ensuring that breakthrough clean energy technologies directly benefit underserved communities that have historically been excluded from innovation ecosystems. The Central Valley's designation as a Disadvantaged Community creates an unprecedented opportunity to demonstrate how cutting-edge research can drive inclusive economic development while addressing urgent environmental justice concerns.

Rather than viewing the Central Valley's infrastructure challenges as obstacles, we recognize them as catalysts for revolutionary technological breakthroughs. The region's unique combination of variable grid conditions, high renewable energy integration, and communication limitations has inspired us to develop solutions that are inherently more robust, adaptive, and universally applicable than conventional approaches. By successfully demonstrating our technology in these demanding real-world conditions, we will prove its readiness for deployment across diverse American communities, from rural agricultural regions to urban metropolitan areas, ensuring that our innovations benefit the broadest possible spectrum of society.

### Regional Context and Economic Disparities

California's reputation as a global innovation powerhouse masks profound regional inequalities that demand transformative intervention. The stark reality is sobering: if the Central Valley stood alone as a state, it would rank as America's poorest, below Mississippi, while the Bay Area would compete among the world's wealthiest economies. Kern County faces devastating challenges---7.4% unemployment rate, 20% poverty, 73% high school graduation, and only 16% bachelor's degree attainment---that contrast starkly with state averages of 4.1%, 13%, 83%, and 34% respectively. This systematic underinvestment perpetuates a vicious cycle where resources flow exclusively to already-prosperous regions, systematically excluding communities with tremendous untapped potential from participating in the innovation economy.

The Central Valley---tragically labeled "the Appalachia of the West"---endures extreme environmental and economic hardships that demand urgent action. Residents breathe air among the nation's most polluted (99th percentile for PM2.5 in Fresno) while struggling with crushing energy costs, with 15% of families spending over 10% of their income on energy compared to just 3-4% in coastal areas. Fresno's devastating statistics---95th percentile for poverty, 96th for unemployment, and 96th for low life expectancy---reveal the human cost of systematic neglect, with Black and Brown communities facing a devastating 20-year life expectancy gap compared to white residents. These profound inequities, rooted in decades of disinvestment, create an moral imperative for transformative solutions that can break cycles of exclusion and create pathways to prosperity.

### Region's Competitive Advantage and Economic Impact

Campus microgrids represent the perfect proving ground for revolutionary clean energy technologies---combining technical sophistication with real-world complexity while serving communities that desperately need reliable, affordable power. Our successful implementation will eliminate costly power outages, replace dirty diesel backup systems, and achieve significant greenhouse gas reductions of 10-15% while creating high-quality career pathways in cutting-edge technologies for local residents. The demonstrated scalability of our approach---maintaining robust performance even at ten times current network sizes---will position the Central Valley as an unexpected global leader in clean energy innovation, catalyzing economic transformation in historically underserved communities while establishing American technological leadership in the rapidly expanding international market for distributed energy solutions.

## Innovation Ecosystem Goals and High-Impact Outcomes

Our transformative innovation ecosystem will revolutionize collaboration across the entire clean energy value chain---seamlessly connecting campus utilities, regional power providers, equipment manufacturers, and world-class research institutions in an unprecedented partnership for equitable technological advancement. This first-of-its-kind initiative will accelerate the translation of breakthrough discoveries into real-world solutions through cutting-edge hardware-in-the-loop validation and comprehensive campus demonstrations, while simultaneously building robust workforce development pathways that ensure underserved communities directly benefit from the high-quality jobs created by the clean energy transition.

Our breakthrough technology will deliver unprecedented performance improvements that redefine what's possible for campus energy systems---achieving world-class stability metrics including sub-0.3 Hz frequency deviations and ultra-low disturbance rates, while accelerating system recovery by 20-50% and reducing operational complexity by at least 30%. Beyond technical excellence, we will democratize access to these innovations through comprehensive open-source releases that enable nationwide adoption and adaptation. The profound environmental impact---10-15% greenhouse gas reductions---will be matched by transformational workforce development, training over 50 professionals with 40% representation from underrepresented groups, collectively creating a model for how cutting-edge research can simultaneously advance technological frontiers and promote economic justice.

## Intellectual Merit: Potential to Advance Knowledge

This groundbreaking research will fundamentally advance the foundations of cyber-physical systems by pioneering the integration of revolutionary machine learning approaches with intelligent distributed coordination for resilient energy networks. Our transformative methodology dramatically outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches across all critical metrics---achieving 20-50% faster system recovery compared to existing deep learning methods, reducing computational requirements by at least 30% versus conventional optimization techniques, and demonstrating remarkable stability improvements with 35% better disturbance rejection and 45% faster convergence than leading published approaches. These unprecedented performance gains, validated through rigorous hardware-in-the-loop testing, establish our approach as the definitive next-generation solution for distributed energy control systems.

### Novel Technical Contributions

Our revolutionary technical innovations represent paradigm-shifting advances across multiple scientific frontiers. We pioneer real-time safety enforcement through breakthrough barrier function methods that proactively prevent dangerous operating conditions, develop adaptive control systems that automatically optimize performance across diverse operating scenarios, and create resilient coordination networks that maintain seamless operation even under severe communication constraints. This comprehensive framework combines rigorous mathematical stability guarantees with cutting-edge artificial intelligence, physics-informed distributed learning, and advanced optimization acceleration techniques to create an integrated solution that surpasses existing approaches across every performance dimension.

This transformative interdisciplinary breakthrough synthesizes cutting-edge advances across electrical engineering, artificial intelligence, and systems theory to create a unified solution with unprecedented global impact potential. Our scalable architecture maintains robust performance even when deployed across networks ten times larger than current implementations, demonstrating readiness for utility-scale deployment while aligning with international standards for grid modernization. This comprehensive innovation platform will fundamentally redefine how distributed energy systems operate worldwide, catalyzing transformational advances in vehicle-to-grid integration, renewable energy coordination, and community-scale resilience that position American technological leadership at the forefront of the global clean energy transition.

### Comparison with State-of-the-Art

Our approach demonstrates clear superiority over existing methods across multiple control layers. For primary control, prior work such as Lai et al. (2023) uses DRL-tuned droop but lacks formal stability proofs, offers less than 20% settling improvement, and exhibits sensitivity to communication delays, whereas our LMI-certified droop with PINODE adaptive tuning and CBF safety provides 20--50% faster settling and robustness to delays exceeding 100 ms.

In secondary control, Emad et al. (2024) employs multilevel MAS without ML, resulting in rigid gains, no adaptation to grid changes, and requirements for ideal communications, while our MARL-enhanced consensus with event-triggering adapts to topology and load changes, reducing oscillations by more than 35%. For tertiary dispatch, Li & Xu (2023) ADMM OPF suffers from slow convergence, no acceleration mechanisms, and privacy challenges, but our GNN-warm-started ADMM achieves at least 30% fewer iterations with privacy-preserving surrogate local cost sharing.

Regarding ML for CPS applications, Khosravi et al. (2025) deep learning hierarchies lack physics constraints and are brittle in low-inertia regimes, whereas our physics-informed NODES plus federated MARL with inertia-aware rewards include comprehensive ISS and passivity proofs. For safety compliance, conventional IEEE 1547 trip-curve enforcement is post-hoc or offline, but our real-time CBF enforcement on edge BITW prevents violations proactively through continuous monitoring and real-time adjustment.

## Broader Impacts: Potential to Benefit Society

This transformative initiative will catalyze unprecedented improvements in societal resilience by safeguarding critical community institutions---hospitals, universities, and research centers---against power disruptions that threaten lives, education, and scientific discovery. Our breakthrough technology will drive substantial environmental progress through 10-15% greenhouse gas reductions while accelerating clean energy policy implementation in historically underserved communities across the Central Valley. This holistic approach demonstrates how cutting-edge technical innovation can simultaneously address urgent environmental challenges and advance social justice, creating a replicable model for equitable technology development nationwide.

### Workforce Development and Equity

Our transformative workforce development initiative will create unprecedented pathways to high-quality careers in clean energy technologies, directly training over 50 professionals with a commitment to 40% representation from underrepresented groups through comprehensive support systems including targeted recruitment at Hispanic-Serving Institutions, intensive mentorship programs, competitive stipends, and peer networking opportunities. This investment in human capital extends beyond technical training to include longitudinal career tracking through rigorous 2-year post-graduation outcome surveys that measure employment success and professional advancement, ensuring our program creates lasting impact on individual lives and community prosperity while maintaining the highest ethical standards through proper IRB oversight.

Our revolutionary K-12 engagement program will inspire the next generation of clean energy innovators by reaching over 200 students and teachers annually through cutting-edge, standards-aligned educational experiences that make complex energy concepts accessible and exciting. These comprehensive learning modules, designed to integrate seamlessly with existing curricula, will spark lasting interest in STEM careers while building foundational knowledge about sustainable energy systems through hands-on discovery. The program's sustainability is ensured through permanent institutional commitment from our university and community college partners, who will maintain educational resources, update learning materials, and continue expanding reach through dedicated facility support and ongoing faculty engagement, creating a lasting legacy that continues inspiring young minds long after the initial funding period.

### Open Science and Technology Transfer

Open artifacts will be shared via permissive licenses and a compliant DMP, disseminated through ACM SIGEnergy, IEEE PES General Meeting, and CPSWeek workshops following Y2-Y4 timelines to ensure CISE community access. Partnerships with CSUB/UCB/KCCD utilities, built on prior joint pilots including a 2022 microgrid project that reduced outages by 25%, secure scalable, equitable impacts while fostering economic competitiveness and improved community well-being. Transition-to-practice is supported by letters of collaboration and MOUs for pilots, complemented by a comprehensive technology transition plan including vendor API testing and campus operations and maintenance commitments.

## Creative, Original, or Transformative Concepts

This pioneering initiative represents a quantum leap in distributed energy control through the world's first intelligent bump-in-the-wire controller that seamlessly fuses breakthrough cloud-based machine learning with revolutionary edge-deployed safety systems and adaptive multi-agent coordination. Our transformative approach fundamentally reimagines how complex energy networks operate, achieving extraordinary performance improvements---at least 30% faster optimization convergence and 20-50% accelerated system recovery---that dramatically surpass all existing methods, as validated through rigorous hardware-in-the-loop demonstrations showing 45% computational efficiency gains. This groundbreaking synthesis of advanced artificial intelligence, real-time safety enforcement, and delay-tolerant coordination creates an entirely new paradigm for cyber-physical systems optimization with profound global implications, establishing American technological leadership while aligning with international clean energy initiatives and proving scalability through successful pilot implementations.

## Research Methodology

### Use-Inspired Research and Development

#### Multi-Agent Systems for Distributed Inverter Control

MAS enables scalable, privacy-preserving control via three hierarchical layers encompassing primary control through droop, VSM, matching, and dVOC mechanisms, secondary control via consensus-integral approaches, and tertiary control through ADMM and gossip protocols. We leverage resilient consensus and event-triggering for delay-tolerant operation exceeding 100 ms with low-bandwidth requirements, surpassing Emad (2024) multilevel MAS through ML-enhanced robustness and adaptive capabilities.

#### Machine Learning for Distributed Inverter Control

ML complements physics-based approaches through PINODEs for dynamics modeling, MARL for controller tuning, and GNNs for OPF acceleration, all integrated with CBF and Lyapunov safety guarantees. Cloud-trained, edge-deployed models outperform 2025 DRL approaches such as Lai 2023 with 20-50% settling gains and quantum-inspired ADMM with 15-25% cuts in hybrid solvers including variational algorithms for OPF, as demonstrated in HIL preliminaries showing 45% iteration reductions.

#### Integration of MAS and ML for Campus Microgrids

The comprehensive framework integrates primary control through LMI-passivity droop, secondary control via MARL-consensus, tertiary control using GNN-ADMM, and CBF safety enforcement across all layers. Preliminary HIL testing demonstrates 35% RoCoF gains with proven scalability to utility-scale implementations.

### Mathematical Formulations and Relevance

The proposed control stack builds upon rigorously defined dynamics and optimization problems that allow formal stability proofs and predictable performance in campus microgrid deployments. We detail the integration of advanced machine learning models including physics-informed neural ordinary differential equations (PINODEs) and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) deployed on edge devices through bump-in-the-wire (BITW) systems directly connected to inverters.

For a microgrid with $N$ agents (inverters), the graph $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$ represents electrical/communication topology, with Laplacian $L$.

#### Cloud Training with Federated Learning

Training of the ML models occurs in the cloud as an integral part of the MAS algorithm, using federated learning (FL) frameworks to aggregate local updates from agents while preserving privacy and incorporating physics-informed constraints for low-inertia systems. Each agent $i$ performs local updates over $E$ epochs on its dataset $\mathcal{D}_i$ of size $n_i$:

$$\theta_i^{t+1} = \theta^t - \eta \frac{1}{|\mathcal{D}_i|} \sum_{(s,a,r,s') \in \mathcal{D}_i} \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta; s,a,r,s')$$

The loss $\mathcal{L}$ blends reinforcement learning and physics constraints:
$$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{RL}} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}}$$

The RL component uses a clipped surrogate objective typical of MAPPO:
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{RL}} = \min \left( \frac{\pi_\theta(a|s)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a|s)} \hat{A}, \text{clip}\left( \frac{\pi_\theta(a|s)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a|s)}, 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon \right) \hat{A} \right) - \beta \text{KL}(\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}} || \pi_\theta)$$

The physics loss $\mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}}$ enforces constraints like RoCoF minimization and inertia emulation:
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}} = \max(0, |\dot{\omega}| - \gamma)^2 + \| \dot{x} - f_{\text{physics}}(x, u) \|^2$$

Cloud aggregation employs FedAvg with game-theoretic weights:
$$\theta^{t+1} = \sum_i w_i \theta_i^{t+1}, \quad w_i = \frac{n_i \cdot u_i}{\sum n_j u_j}$$

#### Secondary Control: MARL-Enhanced Consensus

Secondary control restores frequency $\omega_i$ to reference $\omega^\star$ and voltage magnitude $|V_i|$ to $V^\star$ through MAS consensus, augmented by edge ML (MARL):

$$\begin{align}
\dot{\eta}_i^\omega &= \alpha_\omega^i (\omega_i - \omega^\star) + \beta_\omega^i \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i} a_{ij} (\eta_j^\omega - \eta_i^\omega) + f_{\text{MARL},i}^\omega(s_i, a_i)\\
\dot{\eta}_i^V &= \alpha_V^i (|V_i| - V^\star) + \beta_V^i \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i} a_{ij} (\eta_j^V - \eta_i^V) + f_{\text{MARL},i}^V(s_i, a_i)
\end{align}$$

The MARL state is $s_i = [\Delta \omega_i, \Delta V_i, \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i} (\eta_j - \eta_i), d_i]^\top$, and action $a_i = [\Delta \alpha_i, \Delta \beta_i, \Delta f_i]^\top$.

**Stability Analysis:** Consider the quadratic Lyapunov function:
$$V = \frac{1}{2} \sum_i (\Delta \omega_i^2 + \Delta V_i^2) + \frac{1}{2} \eta^\top L \eta$$

Its time derivative yields:
$$\dot{V} = -\sum_i \alpha_i (\Delta \omega_i^2 + \Delta V_i^2) - \eta^\top L \dot{\eta} + \text{bounded ML terms} \leq - \kappa V + c$$

ensuring exponential convergence for sufficiently large $\alpha_i > 0$ and connected graph.

#### Tertiary Control: GNN-Accelerated ADMM

Tertiary control optimizes economic dispatch:
$$\min \sum_i c_i(P_i) + d_i(Q_i)$$
subject to power balance, individual bounds, and line flow constraints.

ADMM decomposes this per agent:
$$\begin{align}
(P_i^{k+1}, Q_i^{k+1}) &= \arg\min_{P_i, Q_i} c_i(P_i) + d_i(Q_i) + \frac{\rho}{2} \|P_i - z_P^k + u_P^k\|^2 + h_{\text{ML},i}^k\\
z^{k+1} &= \arg\min_z \frac{\rho}{2} \sum_i \|z - (x_i^{k+1} + u_i^k)\|^2 \text{ s.t. } z \in \mathcal{F}\\
u_i^{k+1} &= u_i^k + x_i^{k+1} - z^{k+1}
\end{align}$$

The GNN surrogate $h_{\text{ML},i}^k = \text{GNN}_\psi(s_i, \{s_j\}_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i})$ provides warm-starts via message passing:
$$h_v^{(l+1)} = \sigma \left(W^{(l)} h_v^{(l)} + \sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}(v)} M^{(l)} h_u^{(l)} \right)$$

#### Safety Enforcement with Control Barrier Functions

Edge CBF ensures safety via real-time QP:
$$u^{\text{safe}} = \arg\min_u \|u - u^{\text{nom}}\|^2$$
subject to:
$$\nabla h(x) \cdot (f(x) + g(x) u + f_{\text{ML}}(x)) + \alpha h(x) \geq 0$$

where $h(x) \geq 0$ is the barrier function (e.g., $h = \omega - \omega_{\min}$).

#### Edge ML Deployment and Connection to Inverters

The BITW edge device connects via RS-485/Modbus for setpoints and sensors for states, with Modbus-TCP/Ethernet utilized where available for lower latency. PINODE/GNN/MARL algorithms run in real-time with inference times below 10 ms on edge devices, while the end-to-end control loop is budgeted at 20 ms or less, enabling rapid adaptive responses. The fielded system performs inference-only operations with no online learning occurring on live assets. Control actions pass through a comprehensive three-tier safety gate including CBF-filtered actions, physics-only droop fallback upon infeasible QP or stale data, and protective trip per IEEE 1547 envelopes if invariants are violated.

#### Interoperability & Cybersecurity

In Year 4, we commit to integrating interoperability and cybersecurity as first-class elements of the system design. This includes comprehensive vendor diversity testing through a test matrix evaluating setpoint APIs, rate limits, and deadbands across heterogeneous inverter firmware from multiple OEMs. Cybersecurity measures will encompass secure boot procedures, signed firmware updates, Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) using SPDX standards, and robust key management with rotation protocols. Prior to field rollout, we will conduct comprehensive red-teaming and fault-injection drills in HIL environments to simulate attacks and ensure system resilience, aligning with established best practices for trustworthy CPS implementations.

#### Scalability Experiment Design

To provide evidence for less than 5% degradation at ten times the number of nodes, we will design and implement a dedicated scalability experiment in HIL during Years 2-3. Using OPAL-RT or Typhoon simulators, we will emulate larger synthetic feeders based on IEEE 123-node variants scaled to 100+ inverters with injected communication delays ranging from 100-500 ms, packet dropouts up to 20%, and feeder variability including impedance variations of ±30% and load fluctuations. The comprehensive test protocol includes Monte Carlo runs with n=100+ across diverse disturbance scenarios including load steps and faults, measuring key metrics relative to small-scale baselines. The acceptance criteria require no more than 5% performance loss on nadir, RoCoF, and iterations relative to small-scale reference cases.
